            "3. **Nutrients**: Nutrients are substances that help in maintaining proper health and are required for the survival of an individual.\n",

            "2. **Rickets and Osteomalacia**: Rickets is a condition caused by a lack of vitamin D, leading to softening of the bones in children, while osteomalacia is a condition caused by a lack of vitamin D, leading to softening of the bones in adults.\n",
            "3. **Essential and non-essential amino acids**: Essential amino acids are amino acids that cannot be synthesised by the body and must be obtained through the diet, while non-essential amino acids can be synthesised by the body.\n",
